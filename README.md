This repository contains my first practice project on SQL databases using MySQL.

To run the SQL files in this project, you need to have MySQL installed on your machine. Follow the instructions below to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository : 

        git clone https://github.com/avaghsn/SQL-Journey.git

2. Navigate to the project directory : 

        cd your-repository

3. Open MySQL and create a new database : 
        
        CREATE DATABASE my_database;
        USE my_database;

4. Run the schema.sql file to create the tables :

        mysql -u your_username -p my_database < schema.sql

5. Populate the tables with data using the `data.png` file.
